# Route by vault methodology

This skill returns filing suggestions. It does not write knowledge pages or
move existing notes. If `.vault-meta/mode.json` is absent, use `generic`. If
the file exists but is invalid, fail closed and repair it through a reviewed
configuration operation before suggesting routes; never silently substitute
Generic for corrupt user configuration.

Resolve the installed product root from this skill's own location, not from the
vault or current working directory:

```bash
PRODUCT_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/vendor/claude-obsidian"
CORE="$PRODUCT_ROOT/scripts/claude-obsidian.py"
MODE_HELPER="$PRODUCT_ROOT/scripts/wiki-mode.py"
test -f "$CORE" && test -f "$MODE_HELPER"
```

## Read and route safely

Always select the vault explicitly:

```bash
python3 "$MODE_HELPER" --vault "$VAULT" get
python3 "$MODE_HELPER" --vault "$VAULT" config
python3 "$MODE_HELPER" --vault "$VAULT" route concept "Concept name"
python3 "$MODE_HELPER" --vault "$VAULT" route source "Source title"
```

The helper validates the selected vault, confines paths, sanitizes names, and
prints a suggestion only. A calling skill may override the suggestion when the
user supplies a more specific project, area, MOC, or parent note, but it must
still apply its eventual writes through one operation transaction.

| Mode | Routing intent |
|---|---|
| `generic` | Type-based folders such as sources, entities, concepts, and sessions. |
| `lyt` | Atomic notes under `wiki/notes/`, connected through MOCs. |
| `para` | Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archives chosen by actionability. |
| `zettelkasten` | Flat atomic notes with time-sortable, collision-resistant identifiers and explicit links. |

Use the templates under `templates/` as structural guidance, not authority to
overwrite user conventions.

## Change mode

A mode change is one configuration operation, dry-run first:

1. Read the current `.vault-meta/mode.json`, or start from the helper's default
   config when it is absent.
2. Validate the requested mode as exactly `generic`, `lyt`, `para`, or
   `zettelkasten`. Preserve the other mode-specific settings.
3. Choose and retain a pinned UTC timestamp and operation ID for both commands.
4. Preview the canonical configuration transaction; the command records the
   current target hash and limits the write to `.vault-meta/mode.json`:

   ```bash
   python3 "$CORE" mode set "$MODE" --vault "$VAULT" \
     --generated-at "$GENERATED_AT" --operation-id "$OPERATION_ID"
   ```

5. Show the old mode, new mode, exact changed path, and complete preview. Copy
   its `approved_plan_sha256` only after review.
6. Apply by regenerating that exact vault-bound plan:

   ```bash
   python3 "$CORE" mode set "$MODE" --vault "$VAULT" \
     --generated-at "$GENERATED_AT" --operation-id "$OPERATION_ID" \
     --approved-plan-sha256 "$APPROVAL_SHA256" --apply
   ```

Follow the [operation transaction contract](../co-wiki/references/operation-transactions.md).
Do not use `scripts/wiki-mode.py`'s legacy direct-write `set` action or a setup
script to bypass this workflow.

Changing mode affects routing for future operations only. Never bulk-create
folders, move notes, rewrite wikilinks, or migrate existing pages as a side
effect. If migration is later requested, plan and review it as a distinct
operation with its own hashes and transaction.

## Checkpoint

Observe the user's current structure, think about how they retrieve and act on
notes, verify a few proposed routes before changing configuration, and grow by
revisiting the mode only when real filing friction appears.
